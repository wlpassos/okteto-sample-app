![CI](https://github.com/wlpassos/okteto-sample-app/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

## This is a sample app to interact with Okteto Cloud
The idea here is using a Github workflow pipeline to deploy a sample app in my personal namespace on [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com)

## This repo also use a deploy preview pipeline workflow
The idea is on every pull request we deploy a preview of the environment as a separated deployment and post a comment inside the pull request with the URL.
